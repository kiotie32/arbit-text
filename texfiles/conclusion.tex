Anomaly Detection is one of the important security problem in today's world.A significant number of techniques have been developed which are also based on data analytics techniques.So to identify anomaly we have to understand the flow of system and comparing the data sets we can find out pattern in intrusions or attacks. Attack classification and mapping of attack should be done corresponding to each attack.Machine learning techniques have played an important role in finding anomalies in existing systems.Current systems are evolving and getting mature day by day new attacks surface and along with them new techniques are also evolving. Among the existing approaches how can we increase the accuracy of anomaly detection and reduce false positives in cloud computing is an area which will keep attracting researchers in coming years as more and more techniques evolve.
